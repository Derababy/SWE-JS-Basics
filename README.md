6) Statically typed programming languages perform type checking at compile time. Each variable and expression is already known at compile time e.g Java, C#, C, C++ while Dynamically typed programming languages perform type checking at runtime. Variables can receive different values at runtime and their type is defined at run time e.g Javascript, Python, Ruby, PHP.
 
7) The null data type is an assigned value which means nothing. null is also an object while the undefined data type means that a variable has been declared but not defined yet.
